# Lab 01 ‚Äì Basic Console Programming in C#

This lab focuses on practicing fundamental programming skills using C#. The tasks range from simple input/output operations to conditionals, arithmetic calculations, string handling, and basic algorithm design. All solutions are implemented in a single `.cs` file using `#region` blocks to separate each task clearly.

## üìù Tasks Covered

### 1. Integer Input/Output
Prompt and display two integers from the user.

### 2. Arithmetic Operations
Perform and print sum, difference, product, quotient, and modulus of two numbers.

### 3. Greeting the User
Ask the user's name and greet them with a custom message.

### 4. Age Calculator
Ask for the user's year of birth and calculate their current and next year's age.

### 5. BMI Calculator
Take height (m) and weight (kg) as input, then calculate and display the BMI using:

### 6. Time Formatting
Convert a duration in seconds into a `minutes:seconds` format.

### 7. Password Confirmation
Prompt the user to enter and confirm a password. Display a success message if they match, otherwise show an error.

### 8. Hidden Password Input
Modify Task 7 so that the password input is masked using `*`, and supports backspace for corrections.

### 9. Arithmetic Operation Symbol
Ask the user for two numbers and an operator (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`), then perform and display the result.

### 10. Basic Expression Evaluator
Evaluate simple expressions like `18 / 3`.

### 11. Reverse Polish Notation Evaluator
Evaluate complex expressions using proper parentheses, e.g.:

### 12. Number to Text
Ask for a number between 0‚Äì9 and print its textual representation. Display an error for invalid input.

### 13. Vowel or Consonant
Take a single letter as input and check whether it is a vowel or consonant.

### 14. Pipe Filling Problem
Given a tank volume and flow rates through two pipes, calculate how full the tank is after `T` hours of simultaneous flow.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

1. Open `Lab01.cs` in Visual Studio or any C# editor.
2. Build and run the program.
3. Uncomment the relevant `#region` block to test each task individually.

## üßæ Notes

- All input is taken using `Console.ReadLine()`.
- Outputs are printed with `Console.WriteLine()`.
- Each task is modularized using `#region` directives for clarity and easy navigation.
