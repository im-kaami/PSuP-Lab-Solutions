# Lab 01 – Basic Programming Concepts

This lab covers fundamental concepts in C# including input/output, arithmetic operations, conditionals, and basic string manipulation. All tasks are solved within a single `.cs` file using `#region` blocks for organization.

---

## ✅ Tasks Overview

### 🧮 Task 1 – Integer Input and Output
- Takes two integers from the user and prints them on the screen.

### ➗ Task 2 – Arithmetic Operations
- Takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic: sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder.

### 🔢 Task 3 – Square and Cube
- Takes a number and prints its square and cube.

### 📐 Task 4 – Area of Rectangle
- Calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width.

### 🎯 Task 5 – Simple Conditional
- Takes a number and checks if it’s greater than 100.

### 🔄 Task 6 – Number Swapping
- Swaps two numbers using a temporary variable.

### 🔍 Task 7 – Max and Min
- Takes three numbers and prints the largest and smallest.

## 🛠️ How to Run
Open `Lab01.cs` in Visual Studio or VS Code, build the program, and run it in the terminal. Each task is enclosed in a `#region` block and can be tested individually.

## 🧾 Notes
- All input is taken from the console.
- Output is printed using `Console.WriteLine`.
- Task regions can be collapsed/expanded for better navigation in editors.
